- BNC Cable vs Triax Cable vs SMA Cable 

| BNC Cable | Triax Cable | SMA Cable |
|:----------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|
| The BNC connector (initialism of "Bayonet Neill–Concelman") is a miniature quick connect/disconnect radio frequency connector used for coaxial cable. | Triaxial cable, often referred to as triax for short, is a type of electrical cable similar to coaxial cable, but with the addition of an extra layer of insulation and a second conducting sheath. It provides greater bandwidth and rejection of interference than coax, but is more expensive. | The abbreviation SMA stands for “Sub-Miniature Version A”. In order to maintain the transmission speed of coaxial cables, both versions of the corresponding connectors have a coaxial design. They therefore have good electrical shielding and low electromagnetic |

### Experiment when we use triax and BNC coverter in series.


### Why sometimes we get differnet output graphs even if we use same instrument, same cable and same device.
Reason behind this is **Charge trapping** - Charge trapping refers to the localization of the electron or hole at lattice defects within the crystal structure or at unsaturated bonds on the nanocrystal surface atoms. The charge can become stabilized in these sites, called trapping states, and, therefore, trapping reduces charge mobility in nanocrystal arrays.



 
### Measurment vs Accuracy
### Power line Cycle
NPLC (Number of Power Line Cycles) NPLC stands for Number of Power Line Cycles. NPLC is a measurement term that indicates the accuracy with which a voltage or current is displayed on a device such as a digital multimeter. When determining the value of a DC signal, AC noise is often present by power lines.

NPLC is number of power line cycles.  DC Voltage, DC Current, and Resistance measurement resolution, accuracy is reduced by power line induced AC noise.  Using NPLC of 1 or greater increases AC noise integration time, and increases measurement resolution and accuracy, however the trade-off is slower measurement rates.  For highest measurement accuracy NPLC of 100 is recommended.
### How to find standard deviation of output

### How to measure low resistance 
To measure the low value resistance such as 1 milli-ohm the resistance of interconnects will create the problem.
For the measurement of low resistances, the following methods are used :−

- Ammeter-Voltmeter Method
- Potentiometer Method
- Kelvin Double Bridge Method
